Cross-contamination and runoffs from factory farms are putting everyone at risk.\n\nOvercrowded factory farms, as well as other facilities in which animals are routinely confined, are literally a breeding ground for disease. This fact has been made all the more evident by the recent COVID 19 pandemic, which originated in a live animal market.\n\nApart from the risks posed by corona, avian, and pig flu viruses, harmful bacteria such as campylobacter, salmonella and e.coli from animal products, sicken millions of people every year.\n\nAnother pressing issue is antibiotic resistance. Around 80% of all antibiotics are now fed to farm animals, not just to treat infections, but to keep them alive in unnatural conditions, and as growth promoters. This reckless overuse of our most precious drugs increases the risk of antibiotic resistance, meaning increasing antibiotic failure for human diseases."
